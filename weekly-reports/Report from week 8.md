- Goals for this week:   
	-  Implement other views
- Done:   
	- learning about authentication
- Differences:
	- I didn't code anything, I was just trying to figure out how to do the authentication.
- Goals for next week:
	- prepare the beta version
- Problems: 
	- time management - it was a busy week at school, we had a mid-term and some other deadlines, so I had to study a lot and didn't have much time for my project
	- I am so stressed about the project and its deadline and have some doubts about some important things that need to be done on the project.
