- Differences:  
    - I wanted to add more functionalities to beta version  
- Goals for next week:  
    - add more functionalities and screens  
- Problems:   
    - The main problem this week was adapting my project to FE <-> BE communication using GraphQL. It was my first experience, so it was (and still is) complicated for me to understand the mutations and queries, and I still have a lot of problems with writing the code in React (also my first time). But I think it is getting better and I am getting more familiar with the GraphQL and React with every mutation I try to write.
