- Goals for this week:   
	- Studying frameworks. 
	  
- Done:   
	- During this week I tried to learn the basics of the `Django` framework. I got the material from [`https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/). It was in the form of a tutorial. So the goal was completed. 
    - I also read the hosting documentation and tried to deploy a basic application (just a tiny part from the application from tutorial). At first it worked without problems. However, I decided to 'clean up' my github a bit and the hosting somehow stopped working (deploy is done with every commit). For now it's in the process of being fixed (commit number: [`eb2d21fcc214dedbb1e3c8386e366a1b629a1591`](https://github.com/patriciavnencakova/sports-club-app/commit/eb2d21fcc214dedbb1e3c8386e366a1b629a1591))
	
- Differences:
	- There were no major changes between the goals and what was actually done. In fact, I did more than planned, which was to try and get the hosting up and running.
- Goals for next week:
	- Make hosting work again.
	- Create database models (tables from the specification).

- Problems:
	- The only problem was the deployment, as I mentioned above.
