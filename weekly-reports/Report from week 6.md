- Differences:
	- Hosting still not working.
- Goals for next week:
	- Make hosting work again.
	- Implement some of the views.
- Problems: 
	- The hosting is still not working properly. I hope to fix it next week, otherwise I will have to change hosting service. Deploy fails every time and doesn't show any logs, so it's hard to debug and find out what's wrong. Also it was hard to find the right pace because of the Easter holidays.
