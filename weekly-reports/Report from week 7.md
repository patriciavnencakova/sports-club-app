- Goals for this week:   
	- Make hosting work again.
	- Implement some of the views.
- Done:   
	- I have implemented login and registration views. For testing purposes it was necessary to implement some frontend, so I created a couple of very simple html files (commit number: [`233edcd5798d7d4d570b964f9d662e3311b38872`](https://github.com/patriciavnencakova/sports-club-app/commit/233edcd5798d7d4d570b964f9d662e3311b38872)).
- Differences:
	- Hosting still not working.
- Goals for next week:
	- Implement other views
- Problems: 
	- I had a bit of a problem figuring out how to get only logged in users to the chosen urls. I tried to figure it out myself, so there was no time for hosting. Still needs to be done, but I'm getting close.
